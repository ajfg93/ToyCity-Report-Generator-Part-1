* elsif ~~else if~~
* In ruby if I use a variable prefixed with $ symbol, it is taken as a global variable. So use gloabl variable only if it is required.
* In ruby a constant variable starts with capital letter, usually we are NOT supposed to change a constant value. This might have caused the error in your program.
* In Ruby variable name case matters. Local variables must start with a lower case character. Constants - with an upper case.
